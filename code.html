  <h2>Code</h2>

    <p><a href="https://github.com/tomwadley/ship.js">https://github.com/tomwadley/ship.js</a></p>
    <p>ship.js is a 2d top scrolling arcade style game written in HTML5/Javascript</p>
    <p>It's based on VB6 game I wrote in highschool (see below)</p>
    <p>It takes an XML "mod file" and a canvas element as input. The mod file describes the enemies, weapons, images and sounds that should make up the game. A playable level is then generated based on simple provided generation parameters.</p>
    <p><strong>There is a playable demonstration <a href="{{ site.url }}/ship.js/">here</a></strong></p>
