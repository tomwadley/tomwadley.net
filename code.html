  <h1>Code</h1>

  <p>The following is a collection of side projects and digital art collaborations that I have managed to get onto Github or at least release publicly. It isn't particularly representative of the sort of work I do during the day, nor is it an exhaustive list of everything I've worked on in my spare time.</p>
