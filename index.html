<h1>A bit about myself</h1>

<p>
    I love <strong>Test-Driven Development</strong>, <strong>Continuous Delivery</strong>, and <strong>Infrastructure as Code</strong>.
    With almost a decade of consulting experience at Thoughtworks, I've had the opportunity to work with a number of languages and frameworks, in a range of different domains.
</p>

<p>I consider myself a generalist but with an emphasis on backend development and microservices.</p>

<p>Programming is my hobby and my job. I'm a FOSS enthusiast and all-round computer geek.</p>
